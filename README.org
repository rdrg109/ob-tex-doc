* Warning

This package has only been tested in Linux, you mustn't use this package in Windows. The reason of this warning is because there is a function which recursively delete files (an operation with possible undesirable effects if not executed the right way) in a directory and, for the time being, there are only checks for files located at =/tmp/= (i.e. the path is hardcoded since I hadn't have enough time to test this package on Windows).

* Examples

See [[file:./examples.org]].
